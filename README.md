# graph-creation-for-stock-pitch

This smaller project for a stock pitch was done in copnjuction with an excel DCF for the purposes of a recruitment process. The projected earnings used in the DCF-model for the pitch is the same as used in this graph and based on analyst opinions as well as the companys own guidence for 2026. 

This pitch followed the narrowed market valuation that followed in the aftermath of the companys disappointing Q1 earnings yet with a management that still held onto their 2026 targets with optimism, which created an interesting crossroad in its then shareprice.
